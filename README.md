## 🎯 Project Purpose
We need to develop a **Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard** in Excel to provide better insights and improve patient service efficiency. This dashboard enables hospital management to:
- Monitor patient visits and waiting times
- Identify peak hours and improve resource allocation
- Analyze patient satisfaction levels
- Optimize hospital emergency response times

## 📊 KPI Requirements
### ✅ Number of Patients
- Count the total number of patients visiting the ER each day.
- Display a **daily trend** with an **area sparkline** to observe patterns like busy days or seasonal fluctuations.

### ⏳ Average Wait Time
- Calculate the **average time** patients wait before seeing a medical professional.
- Use an **area sparkline** to track daily changes and highlight days with longer waiting times.

### 😊 Patient Satisfaction Score
- Compute the **average daily satisfaction score** to assess service quality.
- Use an **area sparkline** to monitor trends and identify areas for improvement.

## 📈 Charts Created
1. **Patients Admission Status**: Displaying the number of patients **admitted vs. not admitted**.
2. **Patients Age Distribution**: Categorizing patients based on **age groups**.
3. **Timelines**: Measuring the **percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes**.
4. **Gender Analysis**: Visualizing **patient count by gender**.
5. **Department Referrals**: Identifying the **most referred hospital departments**.

## 🏥 Insights Generated
- Identified peak hours with **highest ER visits** to improve resource planning.
- Determined **departments receiving the most referrals** for better coordination.
- Found patterns in **patient waiting times and satisfaction scores** to enhance service quality.

## 📌 Tech & Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (Primary tool for data processing and dashboard creation)
